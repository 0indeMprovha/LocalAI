# Solterm 5.1.rar: A Software for Solar Energy Simulation and Analysis
 
Solterm 5.1.rar is a compressed file that contains the installation files for Solterm 5.1, a software application developed by LNEG that simulates and analyses the performance of solar systems[^1^]. Solterm 5.1 is the official certification software for calculating the energy balance of renewable energy systems, which are mandatory for all new buildings in Portugal[^1^]. Solterm 5.1 comes with a hourly climate database for the 308 Portuguese municipalities, and the technical specifications of hundreds of certified commercial solar systems used in Portugal[^1^]. The user can simulate the operation of many solar system layouts, and explore economic aspects and environmental benefits, which helps to determine a correct choice of component sizes[^1^].

Solterm 5.1.rar is available for download from various sources on the internet, such as software informer[^1^], praxis benefits[^2^], and sway office[^4^]. However, some of these sources may not be reliable or safe, and may contain malware or viruses. Therefore, it is advisable to download Solterm 5.1.rar from the official website of LNEG or from trusted sources that have verified the file integrity and security. Solterm 5.1.rar is compatible with Windows XP SP2 or higher operating systems[^6^]. To install Solterm 5.1, the user needs to extract the rar file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip, and then run the setup.exe file. The installation process is simple and straightforward, and requires a valid license key that can be obtained from LNEG upon request.
 
Solterm 5.1.rar is a useful tool for anyone interested in solar energy, especially in Portugal. It can help with studies of solar energy use feasibility and suitability, optimization of components and systems, system pre-sizing, preparation of tender offers in public procurement, independent evaluation of projects, education and awareness initiatives on energy and sustainability[^1^]. Solterm 5.1.rar is also a valuable resource for researchers and students who want to learn more about the physics and engineering of solar systems.

Solterm 5.1.rar is based on the TRNSYS simulation engine, which is a well-known and widely used software for transient simulation of thermal and electrical systems. Solterm 5.1.rar allows the user to create and modify solar system models using a graphical interface, where different components can be selected from a library and connected with pipes or wires. Solterm 5.1.rar also provides a database of solar radiation data for different locations in Portugal, which can be used as input for the simulation. The user can specify the simulation period, time step, and output variables, and then run the simulation and view the results in tables or graphs. Solterm 5.1.rar can also perform sensitivity analysis, optimization, and economic evaluation of the solar systems.
 
Solterm 5.1.rar supports various types of solar systems, such as passive solar heating, active solar water heating, photovoltaic systems, solar cooling, and hybrid systems. Solterm 5.1.rar can simulate both domestic and commercial applications, such as single-family houses, apartment buildings, hotels, schools, hospitals, offices, etc. Solterm 5.1.rar can also handle complex systems with multiple collectors, storage tanks, pumps, valves, controllers, heat exchangers, auxiliary heaters, etc. Solterm 5.1.rar can calculate the energy performance of the solar systems according to different standards and criteria, such as the Portuguese building code (RCCTE), the European standard (EN 15316), and the F-Chart method.
 
Solterm 5.1.rar is a powerful and user-friendly software that can help the user to design and evaluate solar systems in a realistic and accurate way. Solterm 5.1.rar can also help the user to comply with the legal requirements and to obtain the benefits of using renewable energy sources. Solterm 5.1.rar is a valuable tool for promoting the development and dissemination of solar energy in Portugal and beyond.
